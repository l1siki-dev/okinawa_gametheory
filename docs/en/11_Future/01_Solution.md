# Future of Okinawa: Creative Digital Island without Aid.  

We have talked enough about the problem. Let’s talk about the future.  

## Future 1. Tourism is a side business.  
As we saw in "9", it has no future.  
No investment in tourism from today.  
But, natural visitors likely stay strong. Just let the market handle it.  

## Future 2. The True Talent: "Masters of Fiction" that fuel the Creative Digital Industry.  
So, what can Okinawa sell to the world?
What natural resources of the Okinawans uniquely have?

As I told you in the history chapter, Okinawa is the **"Master of Fiction."**
Historically, they survived by hiding the truth and navigating between empires with wit and performance.  
Okinawa is the birthplace of Karate. Karate's original meaning was "China Hand"; An Okinawan changed it to "Empty Hand" and convinced the entire of Japan. Now, the Japanese are spreading their culture all over the world.  
Some call this "lying."
**I call it "Creativity."**	

What is the Entertainment Industry? What is a Movie? What is a Video Game?
It is the **Art of Deception.** It is creating a beautiful lie that people pay to experience.  
Think about the best entertainment. Shingeki no Kyojin or Game of Thrones.  
They are full of deception.  

Every good story has a struggle as a theme. 　
Okinawa people know deeply about it.  
They will create the stories that everyone around the world would empathize with.  

Okinawans are natural-born storytellers, performers, and creators. They have the creativity in their DNA and culture.  
"Kijimuna spirit", you might call it. It's a bit different from what I mean, but it gives a cute Trickstar vibe of Okinawa.  

We shouldn't be forcing these brilliant, creative people to serve beer to tourists.  
We should be giving them keyboards and cameras.  
**The Digital Creative Industry** is the perfect fit for the Okinawan character.  
Gaming, Anime, Software, Design.  
These are products you can sell to New York, London, and Paris instantly.  

**The Digital Creative Industry** is the only logical future for an island.  
*   **Agriculture:** Expensive to ship.  
*   **Manufacturing:** Expensive to ship.  
*   **Software/Anime/Gaming:** **Zero shipping costs.**

Software has no shipping costs. It doesn't care that Okinawa is an island. It doesn't need a deep-water port.  

## Future 3. No more Parking lots: Car-free living for people and business.  
But to unleash this Digital Industry, we need the right environment.  
A Digital City requires density. Programmers, artists, and designers need to meet, mix, and collaborate.  

**The Car is the enemy of Density.**
Currently, Okinawa is a car-dependent society. 
This is a societal type that is only acceptable in a country with an abundance of space, oil, or car production. 
Okinawa has no space, no oil, and no car production.  
If you build a gaming studio with 100 creators, you need a parking lot for 100 cars.  
In Naha, where land prices are exploding, this is economic suicide. 
No digital company comes to Okinawa as long as cars are a necessity.  

**The Car is a vampire sucking the blood out of the local economy.**
Because everything has to be imported. Okinawa has no oil or car manufacturing.  
People of Okinawa have to pay billions of yen to Toyota and Saudi Arabia every year, just so people can commute.  

To build a creative city on a small island, we must kill the Car Dependency.  

## Future 4. Replace Cars with Trains: Convert 2 lanes of Route 58 into a High-Speed Tram.  

Before I talk about this, I want to quickly mythbust "The most valuable land is taken by the US".  
Southern Plateau (where Naha is): 150 - 200 km². The US Presence is near zero.  
Central Plateau (where Kadena is): 80 - 100 km². The US Military occupies about 30-40%.  
Tokyo is the best city in Japan because it has the Kanto plain, which is the biggest plain in Japan.  
Okinawa's biggest plain is the Southern Plateau. Thus best land is Naha and its plateau. And no US there.  

The US Military occupies about 15% of the total flat land on the main island (mostly in the Central zone).  
If Okinawa can't produce the result with 85% of the land. They can't do it with an additional 15% of the land.  

So, how to make use of that 85% of the flat land?

**We need an efficient transportation system that replaces cars.**
Rail frees up the massive land wasted on parking lots.  
Also, it is **7 to 9 times** more energy-efficient than cars.  
Rail's efficiency comes from the steel wheel. Monorail has a rubber tire, which is practically a car. Rubber tire is inefficient because it deforms.  

We don't need to dig tunnels through mountains. We don't need to wait for the US Marines to leave.  
We have the land. It is right in front of us.  
**Route 58.**

Route 58 has 6 lanes, an American-style road that is not optimal for Okinawa.  
We will turn two lanes of Route 58 into a High-Speed Surface Railway (LRT).  
Connect Naha to Chatan in 20 minutes.  
It requires no US permission. It requires no tunnels.  
It only requires the courage to say 'No' to the Car society.  

## Future 5. The "Tax-Free" Digital Zone
Once we have the Rail, we stop the "Construction Subsidies" (The 300 Billion Yen). Entirely.  
We replace it with a **Special Tax-Free Zone.**

*   **Corporate Tax for Creative/Tech Companies:** **0%**.  
*   **Income Tax for Creators/Engineers:** **0%**.  

We use the "Aid" money to cover the tax gap.  
This will attract talent from Tokyo, Taiwan, and Singapore.  

## Future 6. dismisses the media cartel

The current generation of people of Okinawa is 'educated' from birth by local media under total control.  
The invisible hand can't fix this 'educated' market.  
The government has to intervene.  

This is important because if local media can distort reality, as they are doing now, any positive development in Okinawa can be reframed as a negative one.  
The Russian people will not change, even if Putin is gone. Okinawa is the same.  

**Public-Private Partnership for Media Pluralism**
Just as the government builds roads that anyone can drive on, the government can subsidize a "Joint Printing Center" in remote islands to ensure all newspapers (national and local) have equal access to the market.  
Any newspaper with a low local market share can use the facility at an affordable fee.  

**Market Concentration Assessment** required by laws.  
The EU recently passed the European Media Freedom Act (EMFA).  
EMFA requires member states to assess if media concentration affects 'pluralism.' 
In Okinawa, a 99% share is not just a monopoly; it is a failure of democracy. 
Japan should adopt similar 'Pluralism Thresholds' that trigger automatic government support for competitors when one entity holds over 50% of the market.  

**JFTC and Resale Price Maintenance System(再販制度)**
Japan has the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) that can address the problem.  
JFTC has a concept of Collective Dominance that can be applied to the Okinawa context.  
In economics, the Okinawa media landscape can be framed as a Cartel. They do not compete on price. They do not compete on narrative. They effectively operate as a single organism with two mouths. (And they have weirdly almost the same sales numbers.)  
Also, newspapers are getting privileged of RPMS. 
If a newspaper, or collective, has >80% market share in a prefecture, it should lose its special legal protections until competition is restored.  

Addressing media dominance is essential, and we can take numerous measures that I can't list here. 
I leave that to you and professional regulators. 

## Future 7. The Institution: Human Resource Exchange.  
"第６次沖縄県観光振興基本計画" [https://ghostarchive.org/archive/2Sjv5](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/2Sjv5)   
I talked about how bad this "Basic Plan" is. In short, it's not a plan. It's at best a diary.  
After reading the PDF. I find the deeper problem. 

A healthy organization has checks and balances. Someone should have read that draft and said, "This is embarrassing. Where are the numbers? We cannot publish this."
The fact that it was approved, printed, and published means that nobody inside the building thought it was weird.  

And that PDF is about the most important business of the prefecture.  

They are in an "Echo Chamber." They only talk to each other, so they think this low standard is normal.  
The culture of the Okinawa Prefectural Government has rotted.  

This is a hard part. Changing the institutional culture is difficult.  
We can't reeducate adults; Okinawa institutions have to exchange personnel with other prefectures.  

Okinawa needs a complete Human Resources overhaul.  
Okinawa needs to exchange its bureaucrats with those of other prefectures.  
Okinawa needs cold, hard eyes from the outside to be audited.  

## Future 8. Abolish the development aid

**Stop it.**
This is the most important.  
Replace it with a tax reduction for the creative digital industry.  

Let Okinawa focus on local development, not outsiders' donations.

Of course, don't cut the regular aid that keeps the Okinawa government running.  

## Future 9. The Rival is Fukuoka.

As long as Okinawa defines its rival(enemy) as Japan/Tokyo, the US, or China, which is a too high wall to climb, Okinawans have to manufacture fake stories to not feel "incapable".  
Okinawa needs a realistic and respectable rival that acts as an achievable goal.  

Everyone loves to talk about Taiwan and Singapore, but it's not a good choice.
* The Taiwan population is too large. (15 times bigger than Okinawa)
* Singapore is too far. (It's important that the rival feels close and concrete; Okinawans have to be able to imagine "Singaporean" vividly.)

Fukuoka is the best choice because it's a good barometer to measure the progress of the Creative Digital Island.
* Fukuoka is "Startup City" (Line, Mercari, etc., have bases there). 
* Population is almost identical: Okinawa (~1.47M) vs. Fukuoka City (~1.64M).
* Both claim to be the "Gateway to Asia."
* Inside the same nation, the battlefield is fair. If it feels not, we can fix it(Like we are doing in this report).
* Okinawans can imagine Fukuoka vividly.

While Okinawa was begging Tokyo for higher subsidies to build another road, Fukuoka was begging Tokyo for permission to lower corporate taxes for startups. And they are successful.

Let them compete; that will create two lively, creative cities.  
Okinawa has beautiful beaches; Fukuoka has none. Creative people are playful people; this is a winnable battle.

## Future 10. Other rival option: Switzerland 

Switzerland was a small, poor country surrounded by empires.
It fit Okinawa narrative.

But today they are the most innovative country that is draining talent from around the world.
They are incredibly wealthy.

Okinawa can't be Switzerland. Because they have unique conditions that Okinawa can't have.
But copying their industry model, especially strong pharmaceuticals, might work in Okinawa. 

What Okinawa can copy relatively easily.
- Patent focus industries
- "The best quality in the world" schools for rich children of Asia. 

Switzerland is strong because it is generating patents. Which you don't have to physically ship.
Okinawa can do the same.

Okinawa is trying to be a financial hub(iirc), but it doesn't work in the expected frontline region.
No one wants to invest their liquid assets in a potentially frozen area. The black swan would create economic chaos that would require mobilizing the assets.

Switzerland is strong because it's one of the least attacked places on the earth. Dispite the country having low military expenses.
It is surrounded by NATO. And Russian riches having assets in Swiss banks. Nobody will attack them.

1.  **Crisis happens:** (e.g., Pandemic, War).
2.  **Availability Bias:** Investors think, "Where is safe? SWITZERLAND!" (It comes to mind first, because they have a bank account or children there, or they spent their childhood there).
3.  **Action:** They buy Francs.
4.  **Result:** The Franc goes up.
5.  **Confirmation Bias:** "See? I was right. The Franc went up. It is safe."

This is just one example of Cognitive Bias they are benefiting from. There are more biases that make the Swiss Franc strong. I can't list here. Because this report is about Okinawa, not Switzerland 

Nobody will attack the US, because the US have massive military. Switzerland did it for zero maintenance cost.
That's why the Swiss Franc is an incredibly strong currency. It ensures the high purchasing power that creates the wealth accumulation loop.

Okinawa doesn't have that luck, but it might get an idea from the country.

## Conclusion: Creative Digital Industry with beautiful Beaches
*   Okinawans do not have to pay for expensive cars.  
*   Okinawans get high-paying creative jobs.  
*   The economy creates a product that China cannot switch off.  
*   Okinawans will value democracy because democracy has actually provided a visible good change.  

**Enjoy beautiful beaches after the tax-free creative work.**
This is the unique Okinawa that attracts talent from all over the world.

# The conclusion: Do not hunt for the villains. Just Retweet.  

Thank you. 
I know this report was long and emotional. You must be tired.  
But you are here. You are here because you care about Japan and its people.  

We have walked through together.  
We have seen how our money is wasted, how our security is undermined, and how Okinawa is kept poor by design.  

But we also saw a bright hope: A Creative Digital Island.

Now, I must ask you to do the hardest thing of all:
**Do not hunt for villains.**

## There are no villains, only true believers.  

As I explained, the politicians and bureaucrats are doing what is best for *them*.
They are not evil. They are rational.
To them, keeping the current system alive looks like "Justice."
To Tokyo, sending money looked like "Stability."
To the local media, fueling the conflict looked like "Righteousness."

They are just true believers trapped in a bad structure.

**The evil is not in the People. The evil is in the Structure.**
All of this was legal. All of this was rational.
But the result was a disaster for Japan.

So, let's not blame people and start **fixing the structure.**
We've already lost too much time and resources; we have to focus on what matters.  

And, Remember? **"The Conflict" is their business.**
That's what kept this scam alive for over 50 years.  
If we start fighting each other—Right vs. Left, Mainland vs. Okinawa—we are just giving them more content for their show. We are giving them more time.

**We will not fall for their trap anymore.**

We will not give them time to entrench.  

**We start dismantling this show today. Here and now.**

## We start now, but how?: By entering the game.  

I told you that we, "the Japanese majority," are the strongest player.  
It means **you** are the boss.  
But a boss who never speaks is a boss who gets ignored.  
Your money continues to be wasted until you raise your voice.  

They fear our voice. So, **don't be silent.** That's what they want.

If the majority of potential voters support ending the harmful aid, the government has to change the current policy to stay in power.  
You don't have to wait till the next election.  
**We can start today, right now.**

To make the majority support this idea, we have to deliver this idea to them.  
Japan is an aging giant. Not everyone has access internet, SNS, or YouTube.  
To win, we need mass media on our side. Nationwide TVs and nationwide newspapers are necessary to secure the majority.  
But, they will not report on this "Taboo" truth unless they feel safe.

## The Strategy: Setting the comfortable ground for the mass media

Japanese newspapers have a unique system that makes them loosely collective. The system is called the Kisha Club.  
A media moves too fast will be punished. Like who says different things from others get punished. "出る杭は打たれる"   
We need to build a condition that a media feels confident that the other media will follow the move.  

**This is where YOU come in.**

When you Retweet, Share, or send this to an influencer, you are not just "clicking a button."
You are sending a signal of the change.
You are telling the media: *"It is safe to talk about this. The audience is ready."*
You are telling the politicians: *"The wind has changed. If you don't fix the structure, you will lose your seat."*

This is the election. In the digital age, every day is Election Day.  
And your smartphone is the ballot box.  
Every Retweet is a vote cast in the open.  

When people see your retweet, they will gain the courage to raise their voice.

## My Final Request: Retweet Now

**Push the first domino.**

(Click the blue icon on the left)

Do not let this report die in your smartphone's browsing history.  
If you know an influential figure—a YouTuber, a politician, a professor, a journalist—send this to them.  
Tell them **you** found the important information.

**Retweet this report now.**
