        **Estimated Profit efficiency: 6.9%**.
        The estimation is what I did for the 2024 data analysis. I assumed 2013 had the same breakdown ratio. 
        2013 likely had lower efficiency against 2024, due to lower prices. So 6.9% is likely higher than the reality.

        Let's estimate the profit.  
        Tourism revenue is difficult to estimate because "tourism" involves various industries with different profit structures (hotels, transport, retail, dining).  
        However, based on Japanese service industry standards and current economic conditions in Okinawa, we can estimate the aggregate operating profit to be roughly **between 50 billion and 80 billion yen (approx. 5% - 8% of revenue).**

        Tourism revenue is not a monolith. We need to break down where that 983.5 billion yen goes and apply average profit margins for those specific industries.  

        **A. Accommodation (Hotels/Ryokans) ~35% of spending**
        *   **Revenue Share:** approx. 344 billion yen.  
        *   **Margin:** The hotel industry typically operates on thin margins (5%), but 2024 saw significant price hikes (ADR - Average Daily Rate increased).  
        *   **Est. Margin:** 10% (High performance due to price increases).  
        *   **Profit:** ~34.4 billion yen.  

        **B. Shopping (Souvenirs/Retail) ~25% of spending**
        *   **Revenue Share:** approx. 246 billion yen.  
        *   **Margin:** Retail operating margins in Japan are generally low.  
        *   **Est. Margin:** 4%.  
        *   **Profit:** ~9.8 billion yen.  

        **C. Food & Beverage ~25% of spending**
        *   **Revenue Share:** approx. 246 billion yen.  
        *   **Margin:** Restaurants face high ingredient costs and labor shortages.  
        *   **Est. Margin:** 5% (Standard for healthy dining businesses).  
        *   **Profit:** ~12.3 billion yen.  

        **D. Transportation (Local) & Activities ~15% of spending**
        *   **Revenue Share:** approx. 147 billion yen.  
        *   **Margin:** Rental cars have high margins currently due to shortages/high prices, but buses/taxis operate on very slim margins.  
        *   **Est. Margin:** 8%.  
        *   **Profit:** ~11.7 billion yen.  

        Summing up the estimated profits:

        *   Accommodation: 34.4
        *   Shopping: 9.8
        *   Food/Bev: 12.3
        *   Transport/Activity: 11.7
        *   **Total Estimated Operating Profit: ~68.2 Billion Yen**
        *   **Total Estimated Margin: ~6.9% **

        This falls squarely in the **50–80 billion yen** range. So, likely not far from the truth.          









### 4. The Narrative Shift

When you use this **"Profit/Incentive"** lens, the landscape of Okinawa's economy looks completely different from the official graph:

1.  **Fiscal Transfers & Pensions (Others)** are the absolute giants. They provide **~1.5 Trillion Yen** of pure cash with zero work/cost attached.
2.  **Military Base Income (~145B)** is actually **4x more valuable** to the asset holders than **Tourism Profit (~36B)**.
    *   Why? Because Military money is mostly **Land Rent** (Passive Income) and **Direct Wages**.
    *   Tourism is a high-cost, low-margin business. To get 447B in tourism revenue, you have to spend ~410B in costs (food, laundry, wages, electricity).
3.  **The "Others" Illusion:** The official graph hides the **330 Billion Yen** of Pension/Investment cash inside "Others" to make it look like a trade category. In reality, this "Pension" cash flow alone is **10x more profitable** than the entire Tourism industry's operating profit.

## Grandma's 1000 Yen allowance vs. selling 1000 Yen ramen.

## Honest Graph: Bases are 4 times bigger than tourism. Tourism practically doesn't exist.

## Honest Graph 2: Politicians have zero incentive to develop Okinawa.
