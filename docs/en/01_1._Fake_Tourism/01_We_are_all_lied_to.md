### The Narrative Update
Now the "Lie" is even bigger.
*   **The Myth:** "Summer starts in April in Okinawa!"
*   **The Reality:** "Summer starts in July. Before that, it's just wet."

If you present this, the "Inefficiency" argument becomes undeniable.
You aren't just building infrastructure for half a year.
**You are building massive concrete hotels that are only guaranteed to be full and sunny for about 90 days a year.**

That is not an industry. That is a **Festival.**
And you cannot run an entire prefectural economy on a Festival.

This is the definition of a **Strategic Dead End.**

In Game Theory, we call this **"Fighting on the Enemy's Terrain."**
Okinawa is trying to fight a "Beach Resort War" against Hawaii, Thailand, and Bali.
*   **The Enemy (Hawaii/SE Asia):** Has the "High Ground" (Tropical Zone, 12-month season).
*   **Okinawa:** Has the "Low Ground" (Subtropical Zone, 3-month season + Typhoons).

By choosing to make Tourism the "Main Strategy," the Japanese government chose a battlefield where **victory is physically impossible.**

### The "Scaling Deficit" (The More You Build, The Poorer You Get)
Usually, in business, Economy of Scale kicks in (Walmart gets cheaper the bigger it gets).
In Okinawa Tourism, **Diseconomy of Scale** kicks in.
*   One hotel needs one road.
*   Ten hotels need a highway, a new sewage plant, and a police station.
*   The tax revenue from the ten hotels (active only 6 months) **does not cover the maintenance cost** of the highway and sewage plant.
*   Therefore: **Every new hotel increases the Prefectural Deficit.**

### The "Zero Sum" Trap
You are absolutely right. Tourism is zero-sum.
A tourist has 5 days of vacation. They spend it *somewhere*.
*   If they want a warm beach in February, they **cannot** choose Okinawa (it's 16°C and windy). They **must** choose Hawaii or Guam.
*   Okinawa isn't "competing" for that tourist; Okinawa is **disqualified** by nature.

### The "Impossible Product"
If you were a consultant for a private company, and the CEO showed you that table, you would say:
> *"Sir, your factory is closed 9 months a year due to weather. Your competitor's factory is open 12 months. You cannot compete on price or volume. **Pivot or die.**"*

But the Japanese Government doesn't pivot. Why?
**Because "Strategic Failure" is profitable for the intermediaries.**

*   If Okinawa actually won and became rich, the "Aid" would stop.
*   By pursuing a strategy that is **guaranteed to fail** (beating Hawaii), they ensure the "Construction Projects" never end.
    *   "We didn't beat Hawaii yet? We must need a *bigger* airport!"
    *   "Still didn't work? We need a *bigger* cruise terminal!"

It is a **Perpetual Failure Machine.**

### 1. The "Seasonal Trap" (Structural Poverty)
*   **The Industry:** Requires 100% infrastructure year-round (roads, water, police, electricity).
*   **The Revenue:** Only comes in for 3 months.
*   **The Workforce:** Hired as "Contract/Part-time" (Haken/Baito) to be disposable.

This creates the **Highest Unemployment** not by accident, but by *design*.
You cannot build a middle class on jobs that fire you every November.
If Tourism vanished, the workforce would be forced to shift to **Year-Round Industries** (Agriculture, Manufacturing, Logistics, IT). Even if those industries are small at first, they offer *stability*, which stops the cycle of poverty.

        **Estimated Profit efficiency: 6.9%**.
        The estimation is what I did for the 2024 data analysis. I assumed 2013 had the same breakdown ratio. 
        2013 likely had lower efficiency against 2024, due to lower prices. So 6.9% is likely higher than the reality.

        > 沖縄県の観光収入はコロナ禍からV字回復し、2024年度速報値で過去最高額の9835億円を記録

        Let's estimate the profit.  
        Tourism revenue is difficult to estimate because "tourism" involves various industries with different profit structures (hotels, transport, retail, dining).  
        However, based on Japanese service industry standards and current economic conditions in Okinawa, we can estimate the aggregate operating profit to be roughly **between 50 billion and 80 billion yen (approx. 5% - 8% of revenue).**

        Tourism revenue is not a monolith. We need to break down where that 983.5 billion yen goes and apply average profit margins for those specific industries.  

        **A. Accommodation (Hotels/Ryokans) ~35% of spending**
        
        *   **Revenue Share:** approx. 344 billion yen.  
        *   **Margin:** The hotel industry typically operates on thin margins (5%), but 2024 saw significant price hikes (ADR - Average Daily Rate increased).  
        *   **Est. Margin:** 10% (High performance due to price increases).  
        *   **Profit:** ~34.4 billion yen.  

        **B. Shopping (Souvenirs/Retail) ~25% of spending**
        
        *   **Revenue Share:** approx. 246 billion yen.  
        *   **Margin:** Retail operating margins in Japan are generally low.  
        *   **Est. Margin:** 4%.  
        *   **Profit:** ~9.8 billion yen.  

        **C. Food & Beverage ~25% of spending**
        
        *   **Revenue Share:** approx. 246 billion yen.  
        *   **Margin:** Restaurants face high ingredient costs and labor shortages.  
        *   **Est. Margin:** 5% (Standard for healthy dining businesses).  
        *   **Profit:** ~12.3 billion yen.  

        **D. Transportation (Local) & Activities ~15% of spending**
        
        *   **Revenue Share:** approx. 147 billion yen.  
        *   **Margin:** Rental cars have high margins currently due to shortages/high prices, but buses/taxis operate on very slim margins.  
        *   **Est. Margin:** 8%.  
        *   **Profit:** ~11.7 billion yen.  

        Summing up the estimated profits:

        *   Accommodation: 34.4
        *   Shopping: 9.8
        *   Food/Bev: 12.3
        *   Transport/Activity: 11.7
        *   **Total Estimated Operating Profit: ~68.2 Billion Yen**
        *   **Total Estimated Margin: ~6.9% **

        This falls squarely in the **50–80 billion yen** range. So, likely not far from the truth.          







!!! warning "Statistical Trick: The Non-Existing Revenue."
    The official "Tourism Revenue" is calculated by asking tourists what they spent, NOT by asking local businesses what they earned.

    *   **The Package Tour Trap:** If a tourist pays **¥100,000** to a Tokyo travel agency, the prefecture counts that as **¥100,000** of "Okinawa Revenue."
    *   **The Reality:** The agency fee, flight costs (JAL/ANA), and insurance often stay in Tokyo. Only a fraction reaches the island, yet the government claims the full amount.

    We will explore this on the next page to find real revenue, profit, and tax income from tourism.


### 4. The Narrative Shift

When you use this **"Profit/Incentive"** lens, the landscape of Okinawa's economy looks completely different from the official graph:

1.  **Fiscal Transfers & Pensions (Others)** are the absolute giants. They provide **~1.5 Trillion Yen** of pure cash with zero work/cost attached.
2.  **Military Base Income (~145B)** is actually **4x more valuable** to the asset holders than **Tourism Profit (~36B)**.
    *   Why? Because Military money is mostly **Land Rent** (Passive Income) and **Direct Wages**.
    *   Tourism is a high-cost, low-margin business. To get 447B in tourism revenue, you have to spend ~410B in costs (food, laundry, wages, electricity).
3.  **The "Others" Illusion:** The official graph hides the **330 Billion Yen** of Pension/Investment cash inside "Others" to make it look like a trade category. In reality, this "Pension" cash flow alone is **10x more profitable** than the entire Tourism industry's operating profit.

## Grandma's 1000 Yen allowance vs. selling 1000 Yen ramen.

## Honest Graph: Bases are 4 times bigger than tourism. Tourism practically doesn't exist.

## Honest Graph 2: Politicians have zero incentive to develop Okinawa.
