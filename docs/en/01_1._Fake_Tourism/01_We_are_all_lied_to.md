# We are all lied to

We were told that tourism is the future.
We were told that tourism is bigger than bases.

We believed it.  
We believed that the Okinawa govt and the Okinawa media are telling the truth.  
We believed that they were the voice of us.

But reality was cruel.

I can't stay silent anymore.
I'm pure Okinawan. Nago and Miyakojima blood runs through my veins.
I'm here to confess the hundreds of lies.

## The critical lie in the official document.
