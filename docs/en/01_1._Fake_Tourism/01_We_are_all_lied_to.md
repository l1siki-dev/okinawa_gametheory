### 4. The Narrative Shift

When you use this **"Profit/Incentive"** lens, the landscape of Okinawa's economy looks completely different from the official graph:

1.  **Fiscal Transfers & Pensions (Others)** are the absolute giants. They provide **~1.5 Trillion Yen** of pure cash with zero work/cost attached.
2.  **Military Base Income (~145B)** is actually **4x more valuable** to the asset holders than **Tourism Profit (~36B)**.
    *   Why? Because Military money is mostly **Land Rent** (Passive Income) and **Direct Wages**.
    *   Tourism is a high-cost, low-margin business. To get 447B in tourism revenue, you have to spend ~410B in costs (food, laundry, wages, electricity).
3.  **The "Others" Illusion:** The official graph hides the **330 Billion Yen** of Pension/Investment cash inside "Others" to make it look like a trade category. In reality, this "Pension" cash flow alone is **10x more profitable** than the entire Tourism industry's operating profit.

## Grandma's 1000 Yen allowance vs. selling 1000 Yen ramen.

## Honest Graph: Bases are 4 times bigger than tourism. Tourism practically doesn't exist.

## Honest Graph 2: Politicians have zero incentive to develop Okinawa.
