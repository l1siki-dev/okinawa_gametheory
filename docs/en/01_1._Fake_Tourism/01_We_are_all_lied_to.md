# First lie: "Tourism is working."

I'm pure Okinawan (Nago + Miyakojima), and here to reveal lies deceiving you.

## Okinawa govt tricked you by hiding the expenses of tourism 
!!! info "They are comparing pure cash and revenue (hiding expenses on tourism)."

        Note
        We were told that tourism is the future.
        We were told that tourism is bigger than bases.
        We believed it.
        We believed that the Okinawa govt and the Okinawa media are telling the truth.
        We believed that they were the voice of us.

### Breakdown of Military-Related Receipts (FY2013 / Heisei 25)
*Source: Statistics on U.S. and SDF Bases in Okinawa (July 2025 Edition)*

1.  **Military Land Lease Fees (軍用地料)**
    *   **83.2 billion yen** (832 億円)
2.  **Military Employee Income (軍雇用者所得)**
    *   **49.6 billion yen** (496 億円)
3.  **Provision of Goods and Services to U.S. Forces, etc. (米軍等への財・サービスの提供)**
    *   **65.9 billion yen** (659 億円)
    *   *Note on the label:* In your text ("米軍等への 米軍基地からの要素所得財・サービスの提供"), it appears two categories may have been pasted together. "Element Income" (Factor Income) typically refers to the sum of Rent and Wages, while this specific number (659) corresponds strictly to the **Provision of Goods and Services**.
4.  **Other (その他)**
    *   **10.5 billion yen** (105 億円)

**Total:** **209.2 billion yen**

### 1. The Exact Components of "Others" (439,544 Million Yen)

Your finding of **411,321 million yen** (Social Security Benefits) is the key. The category "Others" is almost entirely composed of **Pensions & Dividends** flowing into households, rather than business revenues.

It's almost 439,544. 
So we can assume that almost all "the other" is pure cash from the Japanese government.
411,321 / 439,544 = 93%

## Fixed Graph: Tourism practically doesn't exist.

## Improved Graph: Politicians have zero incentive to develop Okinawa.
