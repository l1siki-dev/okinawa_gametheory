# Tourism revenue is fake in the firstplace.

We learned the revenue is decieving figure to hide the poor performance of the tourism. 

Not only the inefficiency, but the tourism revenue figure from the Okinawa govt itself is not real. 
So, the real profit from tourism is even smaller than my calculation, which used the inflated tourism figure they claim.

The official "Tourism Revenue" is calculated by asking tourists what they spent, NOT by asking local businesses what they earned.

-   **The Package Tour Trap:** If a tourist pays **¥100,000** to a Tokyo travel agency, the prefecture counts that as **¥100,000** of "Okinawa Revenue."
-   **The Reality:** The agency fee, flight costs (JAL/ANA), and insurance often stay in Tokyo. Only a fraction reaches the island, yet the government claims the full amount.

Not only that

-   **Non-Tourists counting:** Business travelers and construction workers are counted as "Tourists."
-   **Gross Sales:** It ignores that ~40% of this money immediately leaks out to pay for imported food, fuel, and franchise fees.
